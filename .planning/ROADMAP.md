# Roadmap: wp-qwen3-moe

## Milestones

- 🚧 **v1.0 MVP** - Phases 1-5 (3 of 5 complete, eval + deployment remaining)
- 📋 **v1.1 Adaptive Training Infrastructure** - Phase 6 (planned)

## Overview

Six phases take the project from fragile pipeline scripts to a deployed dual-mode WordPress code model with adaptive training infrastructure. Phases 1-3 built the data pipeline, prepared the model, and trained it. Phase 4 evaluates, Phase 5 deploys, and Phase 6 adds power-primary adaptive training that exploits DGX Spark thermal headroom for optimal throughput.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

<summary>v1.0 MVP Phase Details (Phases 1-3)</summary>

### Phase 1: Pipeline Ready
**Goal**: All pipeline scripts are safe to run at scale and repos.yaml is fully populated with quality-tiered sources, derived from the existing ranked CSVs at `/home/robert_li/Desktop/data/wp-finetune-data/`
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: PIPE-01, PIPE-02, PIPE-03, PIPE-04, PIPE-05, REPO-01, REPO-02, REPO-03, REPO-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Running the pre-flight script with a missing PHPCS install, bad API key, or missing PHP CLI exits with a clear error message before any API calls are made
  2. Killing any long-running script mid-run and restarting it picks up from the last checkpoint rather than restarting from scratch
  3. A conversion script reads `wp_top1000_plugins_final.csv` and `wp_top100_themes_final.csv`, applies quality_tier automatically based on vulnerability data (plugins with unpatched critical CVEs get "assessed" tier with stricter path filters), and writes a valid repos.yaml containing WordPress Core, at least 10 plugins, and at least 5 themes, each with quality_tier, path_filters, and description fields
  4. A test run of phase2_mutate.py with PHPCS unavailable hard-exits instead of silently accepting mutations
  5. All Claude API calls in the pipeline use exponential backoff with jitter and route bulk judging through the Batch API
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Shared utilities and pre-flight (utils.py with extract_json, backoff, checkpoint, Batch API; preflight.py with tool validation)
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — CSV-to-repos.yaml conversion (reads ranked CSVs, filters by installs/rating/vulns, auto-assigns quality_tier, emits validated repos.yaml)

### Phase 2: Dataset Production
**Goal**: The full three-phase data pipeline executes against real repositories and produces a clean, split, multi-format training dataset
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: DATA-01, DATA-02, DATA-03, DATA-04, DATA-05, DATA-06, DATA-07, DATA-08, DATA-09, DATA-10, DATA-11
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. All repositories in repos.yaml are shallow-cloned and PHP functions are extracted with metadata
  2. Functions pass the PHPCS pre-filter before any Claude API judging occurs, and passed/failed examples are stored in separate files
  3. Gap analysis identifies which taxonomy categories are underrepresented and synthetic generation fills those gaps
  4. final_dataset/ contains at least 10,000 examples in OpenAI JSONL, Alpaca JSON, and raw JSONL formats with an 80/10/10 train/val/test split and task tokens present
  5. The wp_gen and wp_judge example counts follow approximately 40/60 gen/judge split (per user decision)
**Plans**: 7 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Config updates (judge threshold >= 8, security auto-FAIL, N/A deflation, rejection templates) + Phase 1 script hardening (clone, extract, judge with utils.py)
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Phase 2 script hardening (mutate PHPCS guard, generate with rejection examples + batch API, judge + judge_dataset with utils.py)
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md — Phase 3 CoT hardening + export dataset update (40/60 ratio, metadata.json, dedup, PHP lint, sample_weight)
- [ ] 02-04-PLAN.md — [GAP CLOSURE] Judge remaining 23 repos via Claude Code agents (auto-pass wordpress-develop core, judge 22 assessed repos with 5 parallel agents)
- [ ] 02-05-PLAN.md — [GAP CLOSURE] Gap analysis + mutations (Python, no LLM) then synthetic generation via Claude Code agents (~500 rejection examples)
- [ ] 02-06-PLAN.md — [GAP CLOSURE] Judge synthetics + generate judge training data via Claude Code agents (rubric-scored 0-100 examples)
- [ ] 02-07-PLAN.md — [GAP CLOSURE] CoT reasoning via Claude Code agents + export dataset (Python) + human validation checkpoint

### Phase 3: Model Prep and Training
**Goal**: Qwen3-30B-A3B (native MoE) has task tokens added, an evaluation suite is ready before training completes, and a trained LoRA adapter exists on disk (kept separate from base model until eval passes)
**Depends on**: Phase 2 (for training data); model prep scripts can be written during Phase 2
**Requirements**: MODL-01, MODL-02, MODL-03, MODL-04, TRNG-01, TRNG-02, TRNG-03, TRNG-04, TRNG-05, TRNG-06, EVAL-01, EVAL-02, EVAL-03, EVAL-04, EVAL-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A smoke test confirms the native MoE model loads, generates coherent text, and recognizes `<wp_gen>` and `<wp_judge>` tokens as single-token IDs
  2. Training completes on DGX Spark without OOM or loss divergence, with W&B tracking showing stable loss and router_aux_loss
  3. eval/eval_gen.py, eval/eval_judge.py, and eval/eval_gate.py are runnable against any served checkpoint before the training run finishes
  4. adapters/qwen3-wp/ exists as a LoRA adapter checkpoint with tokenizer (adapter kept separate until evaluation passes in Phase 4)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Model download, tokenizer extension, config, and test scaffolds (download Qwen3-30B-A3B, add task tokens, mean-init embeddings, smoke test)
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — Evaluation suite in eval/ directory (eval_gen.py PHPCS pass rate, eval_judge.py Spearman correlation, eval_gate.py quality gates, wp-bench config)
- [ ] 03-03-PLAN.md — Training script and merge adapter (Unsloth LoRA config, DGX Spark run, W&B monitoring, adapter save, merge with verification)

### Phase 4: Evaluation
**Goal**: All quality gates pass (static eval + wp-bench) and human has reviewed the results before proceeding to packaging
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: EVAL-01, EVAL-02, EVAL-03, EVAL-04, EVAL-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. PHPCS pass rate on held-out generation tasks exceeds 95%
  2. Judge Spearman correlation on held-out scored pairs exceeds 0.85
  3. Security pass rate exceeds 98%
  4. wp-bench execution and knowledge tests run with scores recorded
  5. Human has reviewed all eval results and approved for packaging
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 04-01: Serve model via vLLM + run static eval suite (PHPCS, Spearman, security gate)
- [ ] 04-02: wp-bench evaluation (clone, install, run WordPress runtime benchmark)
- [ ] 04-03: Human review checkpoint (inspect all eval results, approve or iterate)

### Phase 5: Packaging and Deployment
**Goal**: Model is quantized, served on all DGX Toolbox endpoints, and published to HuggingFace Hub
**Depends on**: Phase 4 (human-approved eval results)
**Requirements**: DPLT-01, DPLT-02, DPLT-03, DPLT-04, DPLT-05, DPLT-06, DPLT-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. LoRA adapter merged into base model (or served via --lora-modules)
  2. AWQ 4-bit quantization produced for vLLM production serving (~8GB)
  3. GGUF quantization produced for Ollama local serving (~9GB)
  4. Model responds at vLLM (:8020), Ollama (:11434), LiteLLM (:4000), Open-WebUI (:12000)
  5. HuggingFace Hub page has model card with eval metrics (including wp-bench scores), quantized download links, and usage examples
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 05-01: Packaging (merge LoRA adapter, AWQ quantization, GGUF quantization)
- [ ] 05-02: Deployment (vLLM serve, Ollama serve, LiteLLM proxy, Open-WebUI demo)
- [ ] 05-03: HuggingFace Hub upload (model card, benchmarks, download links, usage examples)

### v1.1 Adaptive Training Infrastructure

**Milestone Goal:** Replace temperature-zone adaptive planner with power-primary decision engine that correctly exploits the DGX Spark GB10 thermal envelope, plus Unsloth override detection and extended warmup probes.

**Dependency:** dgx-toolbox Phase 13 (telemetry/ package) must be complete before execution.

### Phase 6: Adaptive Training Planner
**Goal**: Training runs automatically adapt batch size, prefetch, workers, and save/eval intervals based on real-time GPU power telemetry, with correct batch/grad_accum coupling and Unsloth override detection
**Depends on**: Phase 5 (v1.0 complete); dgx-toolbox Phase 13 (telemetry/ package)
**Requirements**: ADPT-01, ADPT-02, ADPT-03, BTCH-01, BTCH-02, BTCH-03, TELE-01, TELE-02, TELE-03, TELE-04, PROB-01, PROB-02, PROB-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Running the adaptive-planner skill with GPU at 50W (UNDERUTILIZED zone) recommends batch increase as Rung 1 action, and at 95W+ (THROTTLED zone) recommends batch decrease to 1 -- with temperature only overriding at >=82C regardless of power zone
  2. After any batch_size change, grad_accum is automatically recalculated so that batch_size * grad_accum equals the original effective_batch value (e.g., batch 4->8 causes grad_accum 4->2)
  3. When Unsloth silently overrides batch_size or grad_accum (visible in its startup banner), the override is detected, written to telemetry/training/_unsloth_actuals.json, and all subsequent planner decisions use the Unsloth actual values instead of config values
  4. MemoryWatchdogCallback writes GPU power_watts and mem_available_mb to canonical JSONL every 50 training steps, and a failed run is classified as NORMAL/OOM/HANG/THERMAL by the failure classifier
  5. Warmup probe runs 3-5 real training steps (via dgx-toolbox probe.py) when batch is increased without a prior anchor, and the anchor store persists config+outcome history with cooldown tracking
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md — Core adaptive planner Python module + config (routing, coupling, ladder with tests)
- [x] 06-02-PLAN.md — Extend train_model.py (power sampling via GPUSampler, Unsloth detection via trainer.args, failure classification) + observe-training 82/85C
- [x] 06-03-PLAN.md — Adaptive-planner skill wrapper + run-training Step 8.5 replacement + dgx_toolbox.yaml mount
- [x] 06-04-PLAN.md — Cross-file integration verification + human review checkpoint
